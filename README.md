# infinite-scroll-react
## This task has been done by Daniel Aleksiuk

### Commands to run scripts:
- `npm install` - to install all packages
- `npm start` - to run in dev env 
- `npm run-script build` - to build prod env
- `npm run-script test` - to run jest tests

### What did/used in this solution
- used webpack (dev, prod env)
- used typescript
- used react
- used react hooks
- used scss
- implemented responsive design

### Ideas for future development:
- maybe to create my own hook instead of component
- implement tests
- write more sophisticated webpack config file
- CSS is not well structured and scoped, it would make sense to use more SCCS functionality
- to do bonus tasks (lazy-loading, responsive image solution)
